# Park_chatbot with Clojure

As the first part of the assignment, park_chatbot project is created using clojure to allow the user
to be able to communicate about his walk in parks he can find in Prague. This chatbot interface is 
also aimed to be used later in the second part of the group assignment. This current chatbot generally 
follows the idea of the classical system [ELIZA](https://www.masswerk.at/elizabot/) system.
